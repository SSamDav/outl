# This file is maintained by `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
# Every push to `main` runs the release workflow, which bumps the
# `version` line (computed from `Cargo.toml` + the workflow run
# number) and the three `sha256` lines below in place. The `# anchor:`
# comments are how the workflow finds the right lines — do not remove
# them.
#
# Values committed here are bootstrap placeholders: `version "0.0.0"`
# and zeroed SHAs make `brew install outl-beta` fail loudly until the
# first release fires. They become real on the next push to `main`.
